# Overview
This is a project that served as an introductory experience in C#.  I took on this project to further my experience and add this coding language to my utility belt of other coding languages that I know.  In this project, you will list data structures, variable declaration & manipulation, class declaration & manipulation, method recursion, and more. 

## Description 
This program is a puzzle game with elements of randomness and luck.  The program takes 1 user and puts them against a CPU with a set logic that has random elements.  Each player tries to draw cards to reach a target number without going over. The user and CPU have 5 lives and the loser of 5 rounds, loses the game.   

## Purpose
The main purpose of this program is to demonstrate what I have learned in C#.  Additionally, this program has helped me acquire the skills in working through C# that can be further built upon in the future.

### Future Work

- Fix: In the future, I would fix the target of the game to make it change to add further chaos into the game.
- Improve: In the future, I would like to improve the CPU behavior to be more strategic based on the actual user's performance. 
- Add: In the future, I would like to add playable cards that manipulate the game like forcing the opponent to draw a card.
